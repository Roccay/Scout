# Scout

Ever wondered which outdoor activities or events are near you? Well the solution is here! Scout allows you to look up outdoor activies or events in your area. Know of an activity or event that's currently not listed? As a user you're able to add activies and events to the site! Oh no did you make a mistake with the address or has the activity been relocated? Thats ok because your're able to go back and modify the posts that you have created.
